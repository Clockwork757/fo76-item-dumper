## 76 Item Dumper Tool

#####Pre-Req:
This is meant to be a companion to work with the [ItemExtractorMod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/698), this tool was designed to accepted the output pushed thru the [ModCompanionTool](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/698) as well. Both of these created by mansonew2, shout out to them.
#####Why:
I run my own trade sheet found at **https://trade.rhinos.place** and have already done a good bit of tooling to customize it to my needs. I'm more of a build it vs buy it type too so two birds one stone.
